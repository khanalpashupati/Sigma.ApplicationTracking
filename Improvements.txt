Areas for Improvement

The following areas can be enhanced to improve functionality and scalability:

    Validation for LinkedIn URL:
        Add proper validation for the LinkedInUrl property in DTOs to ensure it accept only valid URL format, similar to email validation.

    Encrypt Sensitive Data:
        Encrypt sensitive information, such as phone numbers, before storing it in the database.

    Logging Implementation:
        Introduce a logging framework (e.g., Serilog or NLog) to track errors, application events, and debugging information for improved monitoring and troubleshooting.

    Bulk Operations:
        Implement bulk operations for creating or updating multiple candidate records at once. This can significantly enhance performance for large datasets.
